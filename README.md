OTT Platform Analysis

Nowadays, watching a movie or a tv program with relatives is uncommon and everyone has their own preferences. As a result, people like to watch movies/shows on their phones or computers. The platform you're using, whether it's MX Player, Amazon Prime, or Netflix, is an OTT platform.These apps have a variety of content and utilise artificial intelligence to recommend content to consumers depending on their earlier browsing history on the app.

Recommendation System

A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.
